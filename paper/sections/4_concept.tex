\section{Concept}
\label{sec:concept}

Present our algorithm in detail.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Why we choose the 2-staged classifier.
	\item How we got the training data (maybe even make this an extra chapter).
	\item Using splits and random recombinations.
	\item Choosing the demand classifier.
	\item Choosing the product classifier.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Elaborate on your idea
	\item First give examples and than try to generalize
\end{itemize}
