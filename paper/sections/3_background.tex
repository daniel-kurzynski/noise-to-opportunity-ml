We would only recommend Post

Formally, we define the problem  

Let $p \in POSTS$ be a post from a business-oriented social networking service.
Figure x shows an example for such a post.
Let $PRODUCT$ denote the set of a company's product.

Then, the problem can be classified as a function $marketing$ \todo{Better name}, such as:
\begin{displaymath}
	nto: POSTS \to PRODUCT \cup {NONE}
\end{displaymath}

If $p$ is a post, then we propose $p$ to a salesman if $marketing(p) != NONE$.
A classification of a post $p \in POSTS$ is $correct$, if it is indeed the correct product recommended.

We have to find a function like this, do ml

optimize for both use cases: For salesman and for machine.

we need training data

small corpus

document-/length mismatch problem (theory vs practice)
