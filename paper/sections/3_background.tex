\subsection{Related Work}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Show related work for text classification (initial presentation)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Problem Definition}
\todo{Class this NTO because}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Different use cases (weigh precision vs recall)
	\item Introduce small corpus problem (few brochures)
	\item Introduce document-/length mismatch problem (theory vs practice)
	\item Formal problem definition
\end{itemize}

\todo{Make a formal problem definition, something like} \\
Let $p \in POSTS$ be a post from a business-oriented social networking service.
Figure x shows an example for such a post.
Let $PRODUCT$ denote the set of a company's product.

Then, the problem can be classified as a function $marketing$ \todo{Better name}, such as:
\begin{displaymath}
	nto: POSTS \to PRODUCT \cup {NONE}
\end{displaymath}

If $p$ is a post, then we propose $p$ to a salesman if $marketing(p) != NONE$.

\todo{Also introduce both use cases: For salesman and for machine.}
A classification of a post $p \in POSTS$ is $correct$, if it is indeed the correct product recommended.

Figure x shows an example for such a post.

\todo{Three posts for each positive case: demand, product}

	Which self-hosted CRM do you recommend?
	I'm looking for a self-hosted CRM for a very small business (so preferably free).
	I've only heard of SugarCRM and vTiger in that category. Do you have any recommendations?
