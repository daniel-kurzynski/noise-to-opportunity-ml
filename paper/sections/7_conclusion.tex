\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this work we presented a new approach to online marketing.

Using a combination of supervised machine learning algorithms, we are able to find customers .

This work focused on business-oriented social networks, however the approach can also be adapted towards consumer-oriented networks like Facebook.
Users might ask for the best running shoes to buy, or where to buy the latest computer laptop.
