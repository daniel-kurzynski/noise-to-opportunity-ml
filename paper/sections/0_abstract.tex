This paper introduces a new approach to find users who are likely to buy a product in social networks.
By listening to noise from social network posts, we identify relevant users.
We do this by classifying whether posts expresses a need for a specific product or not in two steps:
First, we detect whether a post describes a need in something.
Second, we detect which product the post is about.
By using a company's brochures, we minimize the company's integration effort for our system.
However, this is difficult because they differ in style and length and only a few brochures exist for each product.
In this paper we show how to by employing feature selection and document sampling.
Our evaluation has shown the practicability of this approach.
