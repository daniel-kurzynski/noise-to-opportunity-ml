This paper introduces a new approach for companies to find potential customers in social networks.
By listening to noise from social network posts, we identify users, which express a demand for a certain product.
We achieve this identification with a two-stage text categorization classifier:
First, we detect whether the post  expresses a demand for some product in general.
Second, we detect, which product the post is about.
By using the company's brochures, we minimize the integration effort for our system.
However, this approach is difficult, because brochures differ from social network posts in style and length and only a few brochures exist for each product.
By employing feature selection and document sampling we are able to cope with these issues.
Our evaluation has shown the practicability of this approach and supports our decisions for a two-stage classifier, document sampling and, strict feature selection.
