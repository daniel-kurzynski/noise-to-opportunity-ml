Task
------------------------------------------
Recommend business/advertisement brochures for people's blog posts on e.g. LinkedIn.
Furthermore, find out the relevance of a classification for the seller, i.e. how likely is the seller to sell his/her product to the blog post's author.

Further ideas:
	Key phrase extraction, to make the advertisement better. Something like: "You need a solution for xxx. [SAP BlaBla] might be right for you."
	Add amazon products (their descriptions) to test set base
	Crawl LinkedIn posts/profile pages for better results
	Search Google AdWords paper

Technology
------------------------------------------
Command-line tool, which reads from files and prints to console
Libraries
	- Weka
	- Mahout
	- MLib

What do the columns in the traning data mean?

Evaluation
------------------------------------------
For first steps:
Cross-validation with training set

Build a website, where people can set the gold-standard.
Important: Do not recommend a product for every blog post.
